                <p>Let’s just get that out of the way.</p>
                
                <p>Club culture around late 70s and 80s nightlife in NYC was a special, much talked about and written about thing. 
                From the star studded midtown clubs like studio 54 and the first danceteria to the downtown clubs like Mudd + p
                aradise garage. The figures, the music, the looks, the lack of regulation haha. I recognize NY wasn’t all lasers 
                and disco lighting and that simultaneously, there was a lot of crime and poverty and that a huge part of club culture,
                the gay community, at that time were being wiped out by HIV + AIDS. Now in 2019, there’s a pill you can take every day 
                that will at a better than 90% chance prevent you from contracting HIV. This pill was approved by the FDA in 2012. The 
                pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion and so it’s public perception is marred and rightfully so. But the
                fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life saving drug for some, the other very 
                real barrier is awareness. I decided to name, what was otherwise going to be a night of lights and music inspired by an era
                of clubbing that I loved PrEP+ because while designing the club which is inside of an old glass factory basement in Queens 
                (shoutout to The Basement that runs a very awesome techno night on Fridays after us) I started to imagine in an era where
                so many lives were lost and so much promise was lost forever along with them, what would it have been like if something,
                anything had existed that in all probability would’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. I’m an artist, it’s 
                core to my job to imagine realities that don’t necessarily exist and it’s a joy to. A couple days before we threw 
                the party, I was discussing this subject with my team and one of the architects I work with thought that PrEP as a 
                drug had reached ‘100% saturation’ so far as awareness. I thought he was dead wrong so I asked a friend (who I won’t 
                name haha) if he knew what PrEP was and his response was ‘isn’t that some type of viagra or something’. My ex who 
                I was with for several years didn’t know about it when we first met at a gay club in LA.
